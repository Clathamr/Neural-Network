The code in Neural Net.py defines a convolutional neural network which uses a custom data type to enable automatic differentiation and calculate derivatives for backpropagation.

It takes X as input (a list of floats).
It returns Y (a dual number) & Z (a list of dual numbers representing the hidden node outputs).
